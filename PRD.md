Project title: Europe travel guide

Goal: It will show up a list of famous places to visit with couple of pictures from European countries and cities.

Core features:
    1. when enter coutry, it can show the country map with popular cities stand out
    2. by clicking the city name on the map, it will show up the list of popular places to visit with pictures (name of the place + brief description if you like + 2-3 pictures)
    3. a list of events with links that take people to the event web page

Intended pages:
    1. Homepage: a big title or name of the website in the middle, and a background with a travelling photo; also a navigation bar.
    2. Plan your trip: "Where you want to visit?" and a drop down list to select the country (you can just do 2-3 european countries), and the default is the picture of Europe map and people can see country's name clearly on the map.
        after the person enters the country name, and click "submit" button;
        then it will show the country map, with highlighted city name on the map and add the link with its html file
    3. Events: default-list of events going to happen in Europe; after they submit the country name, then only show events that happen in that country (if no events then add message "sorry there is no event hold in XXX")
    4. Contact: add a small introduction and then add a form that includes first and last name, email address, phone number, drop down list of countries, text area for questions, submit and clear buttons.

Design:
    - use green and blue color palette for the web page
    - there is no space on both side of navigation bar, for exmaple, if the background color of navigation bar is blue, it should cover the whole block with no gap on the side
    - homepage background picture should cover the whole page under navigation bar
    - feel free to add the foot note if you want
    - landscape pictures should either align together or all in the middle, you can do something differently but just make sure it looks clear and organized
    - please find good pictures
    - use different html files for each country
    - I want a small rounded border with each event block, you don't need to add a lot of events though, but each event should inclue date, time, location, and link to its own web page
    - the contact form should be in the center
